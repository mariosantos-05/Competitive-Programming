# Competitive Programming Repository - C++

Welcome to the Competitive Programming Repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of solved competitive programming problems in C++. It is designed to help you improve your problem-solving skills, prepare for coding competitions, and learn new algorithms and data structures.

It also has a collection of problems solved while i was taking "Competitive Programming" (PC) classes on UnB(Universidade de Bras√≠lia)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Problems**: Each problem is placed in a directory named after the problem or the platform where it was found. For example, directories could be named `LeetCode`, `Codeforces`, `PC`, or `Beecrowd`.
- **Solutions**: Each problem directory contains a C++ file with the solution, following a consistent naming convention for easy navigation. For example, `problem_name.cpp`.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mariosantos-05/Competitive-Programming.git
   cd Competitive-Programming
   ```

2. **Navigate the Directories**: Browse through the directories to find problems and solutions from different platforms.

3. **Compile and Run Solutions**: Each C++ solution can be compiled and run using standard C++ compilation commands. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 problem_name.cpp -o problem_name
   ./problem_name
   ```
